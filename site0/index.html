				Silkswap augments your online presence. It's a shirt in two realities. Offline, our long-sleeve neoprene is a comfortable, everyday wear in a striking pattern. Online, silkswap becomes a shapeshifter. In photos (eventually videos), you can shapeshift into hundreds of other shirts seamlessly and realistically. For a fraction of the price, get access to fashion's top-of-the-line brands. Think of it as skins and upgrades for your digital avatar.  
				<br><br>
				We're in a closed beta, but are working to open up this digital superpower to everyone. Are you an influencer? We're eager to hear about how you'd use Silkswap. Are you a brand? Silkswap lets you A/B test new lines before expensive production runs. Maybe you're just jealous of how lilmiquela can wear anything she wants, and you're still stuck in 2018 buying physical clothes at full price? Sign up below and we'll keep you up to date and maybe invite you to the closed beta.
